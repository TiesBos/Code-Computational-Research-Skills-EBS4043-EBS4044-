# Code Computational Research Skills EBS4043/EBS4044 
This GitHub page contains the code for the report of the course Computational Research Skills (EBS4044) for the group consisting of Ties Bos, Maciej Korek and Joshua Smilde. More specifically, it contains (1) an R file which was used for sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 ("Clean Code.R") for the statistical analysis, (2) an R file which was used for the monte-carlo simulations in section 2.4 ("Monte-Carlo Simulation.R"), and (3) two python files used for the discrete event simulation in section 3.
